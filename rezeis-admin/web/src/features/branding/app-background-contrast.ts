/**
 * app-background-contrast — vendored from reiwa
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The readability veil that sits under the cabinet's direct copy. The
 * subscriber's cabinet computes it in `reiwa/web/src/lib/app-background-
 * contrast.ts`. The operator's preview has to show the SAME number, because
 * the preview's whole job is to be what the subscriber will see.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The preview used to carry a shorter version of this maths
 * of its own: it read `/#[\da-f]{3,8}/` out of the gradient and nothing else —
 * no interpolation between stops, no stacking of translucent stops, no
 * soft-light pass for the concept texture. The app-background gradient field
 * is free text and `isSafeBrandingGradient` accepts `rgb()`, `hsl()` and the
 * named `black`/`white` exactly as readily as hex, so on inputs an operator
 * can actually type the two answers parted company (measured on this tree):
 *
 *   gradient stops written as rgb()   preview: no veil   cabinet: 0.804
 *   gradient stops written as hsl()   preview: no veil   cabinet: 0.804
 *   a named `white` stop              preview: 0.785     cabinet: 0.808
 *   a translucent stop `#ffffffcc`    preview: 0.785     cabinet: 0.808
 *   a dim bright texture pattern      preview: 0.808     cabinet: no veil
 *
 * The first two rows are the reported damage: the operator approves a light
 * background and the cabinet serves it darkened by 80%. The last row is the
 * same defect facing the other way — the preview dims a background the cabinet
 * leaves bright — and comes from the preview sampling the texture colour at
 * full strength instead of at its configured opacity.
 *
 * WHY A VERBATIM COPY, NOT A PORT. This repo already vendors reiwa code that
 * must not drift: `src/features/landing-builder/live/` is copied by
 * `scripts/sync-landing-kit.mjs` and byte-frozen by `live-kit-manifest.test.ts`,
 * after a hand-maintained preview re-implementation of the landing renderer
 * drifted from production in 12 documented ways. That is the same failure this
 * file just had, so it gets the same treatment, one file wide: everything below
 * the marker is a byte-for-byte copy of reiwa's module, and
 * `app-background-contrast.parity.test.ts` goes red both when this copy is
 * hand-edited and when reiwa's original moves on without it.
 *
 * The alternative precedent in this folder — `app-texture.ts`, re-typed by hand
 * from reiwa's `lib/app-texture.ts` — is the one NOT to follow: the two copies
 * agree today, but nothing checks that they do, so the agreement is luck.
 *
 * To change the algorithm: change it in reiwa, then copy the body below across.
 *
 * ── ADAPTED HEADER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * reiwa's file opens with `import type { Branding } from "@/types/branding";`.
 * That module is the cabinet's, so the ONE edit this copy carries is a local
 * declaration of the four branding fields the algorithm reads. Structural
 * typing makes the admin drafts (`BrandingAppBackgroundDraft`,
 * `BrandingSurfaceThemeDraft`) assignable with no conversion step, and the
 * parity test starts its byte comparison below this block — so the
 * substitution cannot quietly grow into a second edit.

   * This used to return `linear-gradient(180deg, edge 0%, veil 16% … 84%, edge
   * 100%)` with `edge = veilOpacity + 0.12`, on a layer that is
   * `absolute inset-0` over the whole `100dvh` shell. The bottom ramp therefore
   * painted the bottom 16% of the VIEWPORT — about 130px on a phone — darker
   * (or, on a white veil, lighter) than the rest of the page, full-bleed across
   * it. That is exactly where the floating bottom-nav pill sits, and the pill is

   * and the panel's branding preview reproduced it faithfully by rendering this
   * same string.
   *
   * Removing it costs no readability. AA is carried ENTIRELY by
   * `chosen.veilOpacity`: `resolveVeilCandidate` returns a candidate only when
   * `supportsContrast` clears 4.5:1 for both text colours against every painted
   * sample at that opacity, so the flat middle of the old gradient already WAS
   * the guarantee and the two end stops were decorative headroom above it. It is
   * also what the guards measure — `app-background-contrast.test.ts` asserts
   * against `weakestZoneOpacity()`, the smallest alpha appearing in this value,
   * and the panel's `theme-presets.test.ts` asserts against `veilOpacity`
   * itself. Both keep reading the same number they read before.
   *
   * Keep this a single colour. Any position-dependent alpha here puts a band
   * back under the navigation, and this layer has no way to know where the
   * navigation is.

 * bit-identical to the one this module used to compute. It earns its place
 * because this is the hottest arithmetic here: `requiredVeilOpacity` bisects 18
 * times for every (sample, text colour) pair that fails, and `concept-am` alone
 * evaluated the two `**` calls about 14 million times for one veil.
