/**
 * Giving Paper's WebGL context back (panel side).
 *
 * `@paper-design/shaders-react` creates its own canvas and its own WebGL2
 * context, and its `dispose()` deletes the program, the textures and the canvas
 * — but never calls `WEBGL_lose_context.loseContext()`. Dropping the reference
 * does not return the slot: WebKit frees one only when the context object is
 * destroyed, and it caps a web-content process at 16 before it starts recycling
 * the oldest and handing out an unrecoverable SyntheticLostContext. Six effects
 * come out of `components/reactbits/paper.tsx`, and the branding card tab shows
 * them as live tiles, so clicking through the picker reached that cap on its
 * own and the previews went black for the rest of the session.
 *
 * The release existed here too. It just never ran: it read the element out of a
 * `useRef` from a `useEffect` cleanup, and React had already cleared that ref —
 * for a deleted subtree refs are detached in the MUTATION phase while passive
 * cleanups are deferred and flushed after paint.
 *
 * The hook is TWO changes, and either one alone would make the release run: the
 * cleanup is a layout effect, and the element is captured into a local at
 * mount. A file that only checked "the release runs" would therefore pin the
 * pair and neither half — reverting `useLayoutEffect` would stay green, and so
 * would deleting the capture. So each half is pinned on its own below, through
 * the real hook rather than a local probe:
 *
 *  - the LAYOUT half, by WHEN the release runs: inside the mutation phase, with
 *    the shader's <div> still in the document. A passive cleanup runs after the
 *    whole commit, against a subtree React has finished detaching.
 *  - the CAPTURE half, by making the release survive a ref that is already
 *    empty when the cleanup runs. A layout cleanup means React no longer
 *    produces that state by itself, so the test produces it directly — it is
 *    precisely the state the shipped bug ran in.
 *
 * NOT COVERED: `@paper-design/shaders-react` is mocked by a stand-in that
 * forwards the ref it is handed to its own <div>. Whether the real component
 * chain forwards a ref to a `PaperShaderElement` at all, and whether that
 * element carries a `paperShaderMount` with a live `canvasElement`, is assumed
 * here and asserted nowhere; a package upgrade that stopped forwarding refs
 * would leave every test below green and the release dead.
