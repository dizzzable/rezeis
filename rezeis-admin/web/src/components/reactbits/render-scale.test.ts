 * The device-pixel budget every effect's drawing buffer is sized through.

 *   1. below the budget the answer is EXACTLY 1 — cards, panel previews and
 *      phones must come out bit-identical to what they render today, or the
 *      cap has quietly become a redesign of the artwork;
 *   2. above it, the resulting buffer is inside the budget — asserted by
 *      recomputing `css × css × ratio²` from the returned scale, so a wrong
 *      formula fails here even if the returned number looks plausible.
