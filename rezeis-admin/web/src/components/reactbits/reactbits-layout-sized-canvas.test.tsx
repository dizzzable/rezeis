/**
 * The three fiber-backed effects must measure their LAYOUT box, not their
 * painted one.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. fiber measures with react-use-measure, whose default is
 * `getBoundingClientRect()` — TRANSFORMED geometry — and then writes that
 * measurement straight back into `canvas.style.width/height`, which is a
 * LAYOUT property. The two disagree under any ancestor transform, and fiber
 * ends up scaling the canvas by the transform so the browser can scale it
 * again. `offsetSize: true` swaps the measurement for offsetWidth/offsetHeight,
 * which a transform cannot see, and closes that loop.
 *
 * It is reachable: the panel's card-effect preview tiles carry
 * `hover:scale-[1.03]`, and react-use-measure re-measures on scroll.
 *
 * This file used to justify the same option by a `transform: scale()`
 * resolution governor in `AppBackground`. That governor has been deleted — it
 * changed the picture, was inert for the twenty effects that measure with gBCR,
 * and clipped `prismGrid` — and the drawing buffer is now capped inside each
 * effect instead (`render-scale.ts`). The option survives it because the reason
 * above never depended on it.
 *
 * HOW IT IS ASSERTED WITHOUT A GPU. The literal proof would be the GL drawing
 * buffer's dimensions, and jsdom has no GL. But fiber refuses to build a
 * renderer at all while the size it measured is zero — and jsdom hands every
 * element a layout box of exactly 0×0 while letting `getBoundingClientRect()`
 * be stubbed to anything. So a container that PAINTS at 800×600 and LAYS OUT
 * at 0×0 splits the two measurements cleanly:
 *   - measuring layout  → 0×0 → fiber never asks the canvas for a context;
 *   - measuring paint   → 800×600 → fiber builds a renderer, and the first
 *     thing three.js does is `getContext` on that canvas.
 * So `getContext` was never called IS the assertion that the layout box is
 * what these components size themselves from, and it exercises the real chain
 * end to end — component prop → fiber → the installed react-use-measure —
 * with nothing mocked in the middle.
 *
 * What is NOT asserted here, stated so it is not assumed: that three.js then
 * multiplies that size by the pixel ratio into the actual buffer. That is
 * `WebGLRenderer.setSize`'s documented contract and needs a GPU to observe.
 * reiwa's `web/test/react-use-measure-offset-size.test.tsx` pins the other half
 * — that the INSTALLED react-use-measure really does switch to
 * offsetWidth/offsetHeight — because that is the link a dependency bump could
 * remove without a sound.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ALSO HERE. `AppBackground` lives in reiwa; these
 * three components are kept BYTE-IDENTICAL between the two repositories, so in
 * this one the option currently changes nothing (with no transform above them,
 * the layout box and the painted box are the same box). The file earns its
 * place by stopping this copy from drifting back — a divergence that would show
 * up in neither repository's behaviour until the shared component was next
 * synced, and would then land as a silent full-screen regression in the other.
