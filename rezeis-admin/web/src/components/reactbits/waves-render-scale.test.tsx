// @vitest-environment jsdom

/**
 * Waves draws on the MAIN THREAD, so its bitmap is capped — and capping a
 * bitmap must not move a single line.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES. A previous round sized this canvas from `offsetWidth`
 * instead of `getBoundingClientRect()` and pushed the pointer through the ratio
 * between the two, so that a `transform: scale()` above the component would
 * shrink the bitmap. That transform is gone: it changed the picture (a 10 px
 * lattice became 33 px), it was invisible to the twenty effects that measure
 * with gBCR, and it clipped `prismGrid`. The cap now lives here, on the BITMAP
 * only, with the CSS box left exactly as CSS made it.
 *
 * WHY THE LATTICE PITCH IS THE ASSERTION. `canvas.width` alone would pass for
 * both designs — the old one also shrank the bitmap. What tells them apart is
 * what happens to the drawing: under the old design every point moved, under
 * this one none of them do. The path is read back out of the 2d context, so
 * `xGap` is measured where it is actually drawn rather than where it is
 * configured.
 *
 * NOT ASSERTED, because jsdom cannot: that a real 2d context resamples through
 * `setTransform`. jsdom has no rasteriser. The transform CALL is asserted; what
 * the GPU does with it is the platform's contract.
